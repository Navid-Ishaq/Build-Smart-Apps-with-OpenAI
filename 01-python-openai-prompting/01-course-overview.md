# 🧠 **Lecture 1 — Introduction to Practical Prompt Engineering & Course Vision**

---

## 🎯 **Lecture Core Message**

This isn’t a typical “YouTube-style prompt course.”
This is **industry-focused AI training** from someone who’s been working in data science, ML, and AI roles *since 2011*.
The instructor, **Slava Rasbach**, has built models and solutions for top Australian corporations and now teaches how to *turn LLMs (like GPT-4)* into commercial, profitable tools.

---

## 🧩 **Key Themes Covered**

### **1️⃣ Difference from Other Courses**

* Most online “prompt engineering” courses are made by:

  * Recent graduates or interns
  * Marketing/sales teams
  * Academics who lack *real commercial experience*
* This course comes from **a practitioner**, not just a theorist.
  → It focuses on *how LLMs are used in real businesses* — automation, analytics, and decision systems.

---

### **2️⃣ Instructor Background**

**Slava Rasbach** – Data scientist & ML engineer (since 2011)
Worked in:

* Major Australian **supermarket chain**
* Leading **energy company**
* **Multinational gambling company**
* **Top-tier Australian bank**
* **Sports betting platform (Flutter Group)**
* **Western Australia Power Grid**

🧠 *He has solved actual data engineering, ML deployment, and forecasting problems across multiple domains.*

---

### **3️⃣ Why This Course Exists**

> “Prompt engineering will be the most demanded skill in the data industry in the next 12–24 months.”

LLMs (like GPT-4) are **redefining** data science — moving from *“model training”* to *“model utilization.”*
This course teaches how to **interact with LLMs at a professional level** — turning prompts into functional systems and tools.

### **4️⃣ What You’ll Actually Learn**

| Module                             | Core Skills                            | Real-World Purpose                         |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Prompt Engineering Foundations** | Writing precise, context-rich prompts  | Get accurate, stable results from GPT-4    |
| **Python + OpenAI API**            | Query LLMs programmatically            | Build scalable, real applications          |
| **Chain-of-Thought Prompting**     | Step-by-step reasoning prompts         | Improve accuracy in reasoning tasks        |
| **Multi-Turn Conversations**       | Maintain context across user sessions  | Chatbot, assistant, or workflow automation |
| **Prompt Hacking & Security**      | Understand & defend against jailbreaks | Build safe AI systems                      |
| **Data Extraction via LLMs**       | Extract structured info from text      | Automate data pipelines                    |
| **Testing & Validation**           | Evaluate AI outputs objectively        | Ensure consistent model behavior           |

---

### **5️⃣ Python Prerequisite — No Need to Panic**

* You **don’t need to know Python** before starting.
* The course literally teaches you to **prompt ChatGPT to teach you Python.**
* You’ll use GPT itself as your tutor — the same way you’re using me 😉
* You’ll then apply that Python to **call OpenAI APIs** and automate GPT workflows.

---

### **6️⃣ The Secret Sauce — “Industry Mentorship Inside the Course”**

The instructor’s **teaching style = experience + shortcuts + anti-textbook logic.**
He focuses on:

* How real companies **monetize** LLMs
* How to identify **commercially viable GPT solutions**
* How to debug, secure, and scale them

So it’s not just “how to talk to GPT,”
it’s “how to make GPT work like a product.”

---

## 🧠 **Concept Summary: What Is Prompt Engineering (Defined Here)**

> “Prompt Engineering = The skill of finding the right prompt to get the right result from an LLM.”

* A *prompt* is a precise combination of **instruction + context + structure.**
* It’s like *writing a query for an intelligent but unpredictable system.*
* With expert-level prompting, you can:

  * Automate writing, data extraction, and reasoning tasks
  * Replace complex ML pipelines with GPT-based functions
  * Build “AI workers” that operate from your instructions

## ⚡ **Core Tools Introduced**

| Tool / Concept                    | Purpose                                          |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **OpenAI API**                    | The main interface to call GPT-3.5 or GPT-4      |
| **Python Requests**               | To make API calls and receive results            |
| **JSON Mode**                     | To format GPT output for structured applications |
| **Chain-of-Thought Prompting**    | To improve accuracy in reasoning-heavy queries   |
| **Multi-Turn Session Management** | To simulate chat memory                          |
| **Prompt Hacking Awareness**      | To avoid exploitation or malicious injection     |
| **Data Validation**               | To test and measure GPT output consistency       |

## 🧩 **Industry Impact & Career Angle**

Slava predicts a shift:

> “AI Engineers → Prompt Engineers → Prompt Architects”

In 2025–26, companies will:

* Hire specialists who know *how to talk to AI systems productively*
* Pay more for *prompt-based automation than traditional ML pipelines*
* Build *compliance-safe, data-aware LLM apps*

That’s where your skill will fit — right between **AI logic and API integration.**

---

## 💡 **Mindset Takeaway**

> “You don’t need to build AI models — you need to learn how to *use* them commercially.”

If you can:

* Write intelligent prompts
* Connect APIs
* Validate and package outputs

Then you can **sell ready-to-use AI apps** without being a hardcore coder.

That’s the *spirit of this specialization.*
